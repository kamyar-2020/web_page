### <span style = " color : #D2E704">Interests</span>
<p style = "background-color : #97A900; color : white" id = "Interest">
    Well obviously according to previous section my main interest and hobby is to work with computer and program or even to learn different programming languages. i actually spend most of my time doing it.<br>
    next thing that i mostly do is surfing the internet and searching for different things in social media, which i think is the main hobby of people noawdays.<br>
    hanging out with my friends is my next hobby. actually miss the days i used to hang out with them for most of the time. now i don't regurally.<br>
    another one is watching movies. after the covid-19 pandemic and several lockdown it's been one of my main interests.

### <span style = " color : #2A9BFF">Goals</span>

<p style = "background-color : #00169F; color : white" id = "Goals">
Before i begin to start sharing my goals with you, i should tell you that you need to <b>keep your goals as a secret to yourself</b> and hide it in the public so i'm going to talk about them in general.<br>
First,i'd rather to shine with experience and skilles than the things you learn in university. I mean <b>don't stick just to things you learn in the university</b> go and try and comprehend them by yourself.<br>
Second,if you want to be your targets be straight in your road,see yourself in next 5 years that you desire.Thinking about past its better to say killing your time is one of the worst habit that can happen to anyone. so keep your mind in a specific way that makes you the best version of yourself.<br>
however i told you it's better to keep your goals as secrest, but one of my goals which i prefer to say one of my <b>dreams</b> is to go around the world and see how other places look like-images are in the image section.<br>
<strong>Sum up,the one can change you and makes you the real one is you because the one that know you is just you yourself so use other recommendation to shape a way to reach your goals as soon as its possible but be patient.</strong>
