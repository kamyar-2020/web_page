    Well obviously according to previous section my main interest and hobby is to work with computer and program or even to learn different programming languages. i actually spend most of my time doing it.<br>
    next thing that i mostly do is surfing the internet and searching for different things in social media, which i think is the main hobby of people noawdays.<br>
    hanging out with my friends is my next hobby. actually miss the days i used to hang out with them for most of the time. now i don't regurally.<br>
    another one is watching movies. after the covid-19 pandemic and several lockdown it's been one of my main interests.

### <span style = " color : #D2E704">Goals</span>
<p style = "background-color : #97A900; color : white" id = "Goals">
   Before i begin to start sharing my goals with you i should tell you that keep your goals as a secret to yourself and proof it in public so i'm going to talk about them in general.<br>
First,i'd rather to shine with experience and skill than the things you learn in university. I mean don't stick just on things you will be heard on university go and try and comprehend them by yourself.<br>
Second,if you want to be your targets be straight in your road,see yourself in next5 years that you desire.Thinking about past its better to say killing your time is one of the worst habit that can happen to anyone so keep your mind in a specific way that makes you the best version of yourself.<br>
Sum up,the one can change you and makes you the real one is you because the one that know you is just you yourself so use other recommendation to shape a way to reach your goals as soon as its possible but be patient.
