   I am <b style = "color : #15005C">18</b> years old and i was born in <strong style = "color : #15005C">Mashhad-Iran</strong>. Actually now i am studying in the field of Computer Engineering-and I love this field- in <a href = "http://www.iust.ac.ir/en" title = "URL of My Uni WebSite"><b style = "color : #15005C">Elm-o-San'at University(University of Science and Technology of Iran)</b></a> and i am still undergraduate. So, i actually don't have much to say in this case, except that the highschool i studied was located in Mashad, called Mosalla Nejad.

<ul><li><h3>My University Course</h3></li></ul>
<blockquote><em>Computers are incridebly fast, accurate, and stupid; humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are poweful beyond imagination.</em></blockquote>
<p id = "Course">
   As i mentioned before, the course i am studying in the University is <b style = "color : #15005C">Computer Engineering</b>. in this section i want to put some infomation about this course, in case if you want to pick out this course.<br>
   Computer hardware engineers "research, design, develop and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks and routers," according to the <b style = "color : #15005C">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</b>. <b style = "color : #15005C">Computer hardware</b> includes:</p>

   <ul style = "color : #15005C">
   <li><b >microprocessors;</b></li>
      <li><b >memory chips: random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM) and nonvolatile rewritable flash memory;</b></li>
      <li><b >data storage devices: hard disks, solid-state drives and optical drives;</b></li>
      <li><b >input devices: keyboards, mice, joysticks and gaming controllers, cameras, microphones, scanners, touch screens and remote sensors;</b></li>
      <li><b >output devices: printers, monitors, audio devices and remote controls;</b></li>
      <li><b >networking components: adapters, modems, switches and routers.</b></li>
   </ul>
   <p>An important function of computer engineers is <b style = "color : #15005C">to integrate these components into computer and network systems</b>. This all requires a good working knowledge of electrical engineering.</p>
   <p>Another important aspect of computer engineering is software development. <b style = "color : #15005C">Computer software</b> includes:</p>
   <ul style = "color : #15005C">
      <li><b>operating systems;</b></li>
      <li><b>applications: word processing, spreadsheets, accounting, database management, graphics, computer-assisted design (CAD), computer-assisted manufacturing (CAM),              audio, video, media and games;</b></li>
      <li><b>networking and communications: World Wide Web (WWW), voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), instant messaging and email;</b></li>
      <li><b>utilities: file handling, disk management, device drivers, archiving and backup systems;</b></li>
      <li><b>proramming languages: editing, compiling and debugging;</b></li>
      <li><b>security: antivirus, firewalls, encryption and user authentication.</b></li>
   </ul>
<p>And it was a little bit of information about this course.<a href = "https://www.livescience.com/48326-computer-engineering.html#:~:text=Computer%20engineering%20is%20the%20branch,systems%20and%20other%20technological%20devices.">if you want to gain more information about this course you can click on this line.</a></p>

<h3 style = "color : #D2E704">Interests</h3>

<p id = "Interest">
    Well obviously according to previous section my main interest and hobby is to <b style = "color : #15005C">work with computers</b> and program or even to learn different programming languages. I actually spend most of my time doing it. i'm kind of <br>
   Next thing that i mostly do is <b style = "color : #15005C">surfing the internet</b> and searching for different things in social media, which i think is the main thing that people do these days according  to <em style = "color : #15005C">covid-19 pandamic</em>.<br>
   <b style = "color : #15005C">hanging out with my friends</b> is my next hobby. However these days according to the situation that all of us are into, it's been difficult to go outdoor and the time i spend on this case has been reduced.<br>
    As i mentioned, these days we rarely can go outdoor, according to <em style = "color : #15005C">covid-19 pandemic</em>.So i had to stick to an old hobby, <b style = "color : #15005C">watching movies</b>. I actually spend most of my time doing it, and enjoy it very much.

<!---
<h3 style = "color : #2A9BFF">Goals</h3>

<p id = "Goals">
Before i begin to start sharing my goals with you, i should tell you that you need to <b style = "color : #15005C">keep your goals as a secret to yourself</b> and hide it in the public so i'm going to talk about them in general.<br>
First,i'd rather to shine with experience and skilles than the things you learn in university. I mean <b style = "color : #15005C">don't stick just to things you learn in the university</b> go and try and comprehend them by yourself.<br>
Second,if you want to be your targets be straight in your road,see yourself in next 5 years that you desire.Thinking about past its better to say killing your time is one of the worst habit that can happen to anyone. so keep your mind in a specific way that makes you the best version of yourself.<br>
however i told you it's better to keep your goals as secrest, but one of my goals which i prefer to say one of my <b style = "color : #15005C">dreams</b> is to go around the world and see how other places look like-images are in the image section.<br>
<strong style = "color : #15005C">Sum up,the one can change you and makes you the real one is you because the one that know you is just you yourself so use other recommendation to shape a way to reach your goals as soon as its possible but be patient.</strong>
