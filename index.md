### <span style = " color : #D2E704">Interests</span>

<p style = "background-color : #97A900; color : white" id = "Interest">
    Well obviously according to previous section my main interest and hobby is to <b>work with computers</b> and program or even to learn different programming languages. I actually spend most of my time doing it. i'm kind of <br>
   Next thing that i mostly do is <b>surfing the internet</b> and searching for different things in social media, which i think is the main thing that people do these days according  to <em>covid-19 pandamic</em>.<br>
   <b>hanging out with my friends</b> is my next hobby. However these days according to the situation that all of us are into, it's been difficult to go outdoor and the time i spend on this case has been reduced.<br>
    As i mentioned, these days we rarely can go outdoor, according to <em>covid-19 pandemic</em>.So i had to stick to an old hobby, <b>watching movies</b>. I actually spend most of my time doing it, and enjoy it very much.

### <span style = " color : #2A9BFF">Goals</span>

<p style = "background-color : #00169F; color : white" id = "Goals">
Before i begin to start sharing my goals with you, i should tell you that you need to <b>keep your goals as a secret to yourself</b> and hide it in the public so i'm going to talk about them in general.<br>
First,i'd rather to shine with experience and skilles than the things you learn in university. I mean <b>don't stick just to things you learn in the university</b> go and try and comprehend them by yourself.<br>
Second,if you want to be your targets be straight in your road,see yourself in next 5 years that you desire.Thinking about past its better to say killing your time is one of the worst habit that can happen to anyone. so keep your mind in a specific way that makes you the best version of yourself.<br>
however i told you it's better to keep your goals as secrest, but one of my goals which i prefer to say one of my <b>dreams</b> is to go around the world and see how other places look like-images are in the image section.<br>
<strong>Sum up,the one can change you and makes you the real one is you because the one that know you is just you yourself so use other recommendation to shape a way to reach your goals as soon as its possible but be patient.</strong>
